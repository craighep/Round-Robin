# Round-Robin
PHP Round robin- interactive system

Originally created for Aberystwyth University Badminton Club- this PHP application allows users of a round robin style tournement to view fixtures, results and statistics of their team live. Alongside this, an admin section allows for admins to create teams, seperate leagues, and enter fixture results. Neraly all posts are done through Ajax, requiring this application to refresh very little times.
